## Hi there 👋

I'm Enzo, a Game Development student at Tecnocampus focused on programming. I've worked as a programmer on multiple team and solo projects for my studies and I'm always open to learning new skills. I also love game design and I'm really interested in knowing more about it as well as any fields related to it. 

I'm currently working by myself on different prototypes to explore new possibilities for learning and creating.

For my previously mentioned projects, I've worked with Unity (C#) and a bit of Love2D (Lua) and Raylib (C).
